# GameTrade
Gametrade is a social media app that allows you to upload pictures and share them with others.
It was first intended to be as a trading and selling platform for video games and tech parts.
This was my first ever app so expect to see unstructered code, and some redundency. However it still contains some great elements that you can take and use.
<br><br>
The code contains recycler views, collapsing app bar, search bars, gallery picker, image crop library, and much more.<br>
The backend is written with PHP & MySQL. The fetching code contains 2 methods for paging, they're fairly simple.<br>
Firebase authentication is used only for the SMS verification feature, since the app uses whatsApp API to redirect you to the user's phone number if you want to buy or trade with him/her
<br><br>
I discontinued my work on this app, although a lot of improvements can be made, so feel free to change anything and pull request :)
